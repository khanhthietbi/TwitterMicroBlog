# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application
This is application based for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

I made some fixs for mobile display. I removed all SMTP and upload file configuration because I don't wanna lose any private information. You can also deploy this project on Heroku.

I'm really greateful for studying from Rails Tutorial by Mr Hartl. He's absolutely a great teacher.
